when trying to install discord.py, some of you may be getting an error saying your python is externally managed. to get around this, and as a best practice in general, its best to setup a virtual environment and then install discord.py and run the bot through that. 
heres how you do that:

python3 -m venv venv
souurce venv/bin/activate
pip install discord

after you've done that you will also want to add your your bot token as an environment variable.
to do this, you simply want to run the following command, but make sore to substitude [enter token] with your own token!

export TOKEN=[enter token]

also set the id of the guild youre testing this in with the following

export GUILD_ID=[enter guild id]
